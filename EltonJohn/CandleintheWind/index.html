You had the grace to <b>E</b>hold yourself while those around you <b>A</b>crawled<br/>
They crawled out of the <b>E</b>woodwork and they whispered<b>A</b> into your brain<br/>
They sent you on a <b>E</b>treadmill and they made you change your <b>A</b>name<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chorus : <br/>
<br/>
And it <b>B</b>seems to me you lived your life<br/>
Like a <b>E</b>candle in the <b>A</b>wind<br/>
Never <b>E</b>knowing who to cling to when the <b>B</b>rain set in<br/>
And I <b>A</b>would have liked to've known you but I was <b>C#m</b>just a kid<br/>
Your candle burned out <b>B</b>long before your <b>A</b>legend ever <b>E</b>did<br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
Other verses:<br/>
<br/>
Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played<br/>
Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid<br/>
And even when you died, oh, the press still hounded you<br/>
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all<br/>
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled<br/>
Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row<br/>
Who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe<br/>
