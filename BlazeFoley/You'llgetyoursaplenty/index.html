The skies are full of dirt and gray
G
City's kids come out to play
Am
Running in the broken glass
G                 Am
From old deserted windows

Am
Dollar winos fill the streets
G
Poolroom music's soulful beat
Am
Engulfs the gray and dirty air
G                 Am
In the inner city limits


Children run in hopeless heaps
Along the dirty junkie streets
Where women sell themselves to men
Through ruthless mediators

Am
Sidewalk cracks deep and wide 
G
The children kneel to look inside
Am                
For pennies maybe 
G                  Am
nickels dropped in passing

They live the lives like others past
The winos drink, the pimps sell ass
Little girls ten years ago
Are older now by twenty

Social change is still just talk
The things you see in urban walks
Should make you sick and lose your lunch
Inside your high rise diners

Make the laws, you own the man
You hold him down where you can stand
One of these days you'll get yours aplenty
One of these days you'll get yours aplenty
One of these days you'll get yours aplenty â€¦</main>
