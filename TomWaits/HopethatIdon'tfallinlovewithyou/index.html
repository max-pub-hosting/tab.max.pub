        C                 F                 G
Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
          C        F                  G
'Cause falling in love jus' makes me blue
           F              C                   G              C
Well the music plays and you display,  Your heart for me to see
   F              C               Dm           G
I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out to me
       C               F       G         C
And I hope that don't fall in love with you

           C                         F        G
Well the room is crowded,  There's people everywhere
        C               F           G
And I wonder should I offer you a chair
         F                 C                    G                   C
Well if you sit down with this ol' clown, I'll take that frown and break it
   F                  C              Dm                 G  
Before the evening's gone away,  I think that we could make it
       C                 F       G         C 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

           C                F              G
Well the night does funny things inside a man
           C                F             G
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand
        F               C                  G        C
When I turn around to look at you,   You light cigarette
   F              C                  Dm              G  
I wish I had the guts to bum one,   But we've never met
       C                 F       G         C
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

       C                  F               G
I can see that you are lonesome just like me
         C               F           G
And it being late you'd like some company
        F              C                 G               C
Well I turn around to look at you,  And you look back at me
     F                  C                     Dm                 G
The guy you're with has up and split,   The chair next to you's free
       C                  F       G        C
And I hope the you don't fall in love with me

            C                           F             G
Now it's closing time,            The music's fading out
      C                      F             G
Last call for drinks,  I'll have another stout
        F              C                     G             C
When I turn around to look at you,  You're nowhere to be found
     F                  C                             Dm            G
I search the place for your lost face,    Guess I'll have another round
        C                  F            G               C
And I think that I just   fell    in   love    with    you</main>
