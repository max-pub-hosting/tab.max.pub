<b>Am</b>I ran into my old friend Jack.<br/>
<b>C</b>He was dressed in his <b>G</b>Sunday best <br/>
but his <b>D</b>face was red and his eyes were dead.<br/>
<br/>
He <b>D</b>said, "I lost Marina, <br/>
and the <b>Am</b>last place that I seen her,<br/>
<b>C</b>She was makin' <b>G</b>off <br/>
with my best <b>D</b>friend."<br/>
<br/>
I <b>D</b>took him to the water.<br/>
<b>Am</b>I spent fifty dollars<br/>
On <b>C</b>something that would <b>G</b>take him <br/>
to the <b>D</b>moon.<br/>
<br/>
Well he <b>D</b>must have gone to heaven <br/>
'cause <b>Am</b>just before I left him,<br/>
I <b>C</b>tried to wake him <b>G</b>up <br/>
but he wouldn't <b>D</b>move.<br/>
<br/>
chorus:<br/>
So <b>D</b>come on, Carmelita, <br/>
you <b>Am</b>drank too much and I can see that<br/>
<b>C</b>Soon you're gonna <b>G</b>need <br/>
a breath of <b>D</b>air.<br/>
<br/>
We'll <b>D</b>dance across the wheat field, <br/>
there's a <b>Am</b>place I know just east of here<br/>
And it <b>C</b>wouldn't take too <b>G</b>long <br/>
to go down <b>D</b>there.<br/>
<br/>
We'll <b>Am</b>sleep out on the ground<br/>
And in the <b>C</b>morning when we wake up, we'll leave <b>G</b>town.<b>D</b><br/>
<br/>
And I <b>D</b>picked my last tobacco leaf, <br/>
<b>Am</b>soaking wet up to my knees,<br/>
<b>C</b>Out there before the <b>G</b>sun <br/>
was on the <b>D</b>rise.<br/>
<br/>
And you can <b>D</b>have a drink of water, <br/>
but <b>Am</b>don't you look at my daughter,<br/>
Or I'll <b>C</b>come down there and <b>G</b>cut <br/>
you with this <b>D</b>knife.<br/>
<br/>
chorus<br/>
<br/>
<b>D</b>There ain't any flack man, <br/>
but <b>Am</b>if you're a black man<br/>
They'll <b>C</b>put you on a <b>G</b>plane <br/>
back to where you're <b>D</b>from.<br/>
<br/>
