<br/>
<b>G</b>I come up from the bottom rung<br/>
<b>Am</b>I'd been hunting and I <b>C</b>had my gun<br/>
<b>G</b>Wind was still things were quiet<br/>
<b>Am</b>Called for Katie there was <b>C</b>no rep<b>G</b>ly<br/>
<br/>
I checked the shed I checked the barn<br/>
I opened the door and there she was<br/>
In the arms of my friend Joe<br/>
And she wasn't wearing any clothes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>G</b>Katie Katie what I'd do<br/>
<b>Am</b>I was so in <b>C</b>love with you<br/>
<b>G</b>Worked my fingers to the bone<br/>
<b>Am</b>I never even wanted <b>C</b>this old <b>G</b>farm<br/>
<br/>
Joe tried to talk he just coughed<br/>
My heart stopped the gun went off<br/>
Katie screamed out his name<br/>
And then the gun went off again<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Wrapped them up in gunny sacks<br/>
I hitched a wagon threw them in the back<br/>
I buried that Joe down by the creek<br/>
I laid my Katie neath the hickory tree<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Now there's houses up all around this farm<br/>
Staring into new back yards<br/>
Every day they come by<br/>
But I won't sell and I won't say why <br/>
