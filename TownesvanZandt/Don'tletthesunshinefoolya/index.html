Me & this friend named streetlife brown
         A                 E
We got a bottle of red and walked uptown
    B
One hand on the jug and one on time
          A                        E
He said I bet you a dollar against this next line, I said

E              B
 Don't let the sunshine fool ya
A                        E
 Don't let the bluebirds tool ya
E              B
 Don't let the women do ya
A                E
Put your hand in mine

oh advice is fine if you've got a mind
To listen to the end that's got the time
But the muse'll get ya if you don't watch out
He's equipped to know what it's all about

chorus

Fanon street in the afternoon
An easy way to get out of tune
But the hard soap salesman he said no dice
When I asked politely for a better price

chorus

Well here's a song for you child of mine
I hope you make it through this time
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie
No reason in the world that you can't get by

chorus
