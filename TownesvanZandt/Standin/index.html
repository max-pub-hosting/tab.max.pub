That ain't <b>A</b>right, that ain't <b>D</b>wrong<br/>
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it<br/>
Well, I keep on <b>A</b>tryin' but it's been so <b>D</b>long<br/>
<br/>
If I hurt you, I did not mean to<br/>
I beg you pardon, I did not want to<br/>
When I leave you, don't you think about me?<br/>
Well, I won't be back babe, I'll be long gone<br/>
<br/>
When the time comes and I'm not ready<br/>
Seems it's over before I'm started<br/>
Well, the time comes and I don't feel it<br/>
I don't know nothin' but my own<br/>
<br/>
So I'm standin' with my head bowed down, now<br/>
And that ain't right, that ain't wrong<br/>
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it<br/>
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long<br/>
<br/>
Our kingdoms into the sky go<br/>
And the highway like a river does flow<br/>
On my way sometimes it hurts so<br/>
On your way, just don't go home<br/>
<br/>
So I'm standin' with my head bowed down now<br/>
That ain't right, that ain't wrong<br/>
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it<br/>
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm standin' with my head bowed down now<br/>
That ain't right, that ain't wrong<br/>
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it<br/>
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm standin' with my head bowed down now<br/>
That ain't right, that ain't wrong<br/>
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it<br/>
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long<br/>
