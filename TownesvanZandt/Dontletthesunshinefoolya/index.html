We got a <b>A</b>bottle of red and <b>E</b>walked uptown<br/>
One <b>B</b>hand on the jug and one on time<br/>
He said I <b>A</b>bet you a dollar against <b>E</b>this next line, I said<br/>
<br/>
<b>E</b> Don't let the <b>B</b>sunshine fool ya<br/>
<b>A</b> Don't let the bluebirds <b>E</b>tool ya<br/>
<b>E</b> Don't let the <b>B</b>women do ya<br/>
<b>A</b>Put your hand in <b>E</b>mine<br/>
<br/>
oh advice is fine if you've got a mind<br/>
To listen to the end that's got the time<br/>
But the muse'll get ya if you don't watch out<br/>
He's equipped to know what it's all about<br/>

<br/>
Fanon street in the afternoon<br/>
An easy way to get out of tune<br/>
But the hard soap salesman he said no dice<br/>
When I asked politely for a better price<br/>
<br/>
chorus<br/>
<br/>
Well here's a song for you child of mine<br/>
I hope you make it through this time<br/>
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie<br/>
No reason in the world that you can't get by<br/>
