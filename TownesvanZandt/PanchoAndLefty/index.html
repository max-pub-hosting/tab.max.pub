<b>G</b>Is gonna keep you free and clean  <br/>
<b>F</b>Now you wear your skin like iron  <br/>
<b>C</b>Your breath as hard as <b>G</b>kerosene  <br/>
<b>F</b>Weren't your mama's only boy  <br/>
But her <b>C</b>favorite one it <b>F</b>seems  <br/>
She <b>Am</b>began to cry when you <b>F</b>said good<b>G</b>bye  <br/>
And <b>F</b>sank into your <b>Am</b>dreams  <br/>
<br/>
<b>C</b>Pancho was a bandit boys   <br/>
<b>G</b>his horse fast as polished steel  <br/>
<b>F</b>He wore his gun outside his pants  <br/>
<b>C</b>For all the honest <b>G</b>world to feel  <br/>
<b>F</b>But Pancho met his match you know   <br/>
on the <b>C</b>deserts down in <b>F</b>Mexico  <br/>
<b>Am</b>Nobody heard his <b>F</b>dying <b>G</b>words   <br/>
ah but <b>F</b>that's the way it <b>Am</b>goes  <br/>
<br/>
chorus:<br/>
<b>F</b>All the Federales say   <br/>
<b>C</b>they could have had him <b>F</b>any day  <br/>
<b>Am</b>They only let him <b>F</b>slip a<b>G</b>way   <br/>
out of <b>F</b>kindness I sup<b>Am</b>pose<br/>
<br/>
<b>C</b>Lefty he can't sing the blues   <br/>
<b>G</b>all night long like he used to  <br/>
<b>F</b>The dust that Pancho bit down south   <br/>
<b>C</b>ended up in <b>G</b>Lefty's mouth  <br/>
<b>F</b>When they laid poor Pancho low   <br/>
<b>C</b>Lefty split for <b>F</b>Ohio  <br/>
<b>Am</b>Where he got the <b>F</b>bread to <b>G</b>go   <br/>
there <b>F</b>ain't nobody <b>Am</b>knows  <br/>
<br/>
:chorus  <br/>
<br/>
<b>C</b>Poets tell how Pancho fell   <br/>
<b>G</b>and Lefty's living in a cheap hotel  <br/>
<b>F</b>The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold   <br/>
And <b>C</b>so the story <b>G</b>ends we're told  <br/>
<b>F</b>Pancho needs your prayers it's true   <br/>
<b>C</b>but save a few for <b>F</b>Lefty too  <br/>
<b>Am</b>He only did what he <b>F</b>had to <b>G</b>do    <br/>
and <b>F</b>now he's growing <b>Am</b>old  <br/>
