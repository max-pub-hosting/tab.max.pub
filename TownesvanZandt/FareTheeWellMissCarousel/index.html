<br/>
Well the lady's been told that all her gold<br/>
is worth so much she can't be sold<br/>
No time to weep, she'll later sleep tomorrow<br/>
When she carries her face to the market place<br/>
and bets it on the open enrage<br/>
She can ring her bells, miss Carousel,<br/>
 but this singing brings me sorrow<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and get me when<br/>
You're sure that you don't need me then<br/>
I'll stand outside your window<br/>
and proudly call your name<br/>
<br/>
But it's always done, every mothers sun<br/>
is surely grown, and never run<br/>
So they fight with all their might inside them<br/>
When the battles been fought 'n they all been taught<br/>
that the trick is just not being caught<br/>
Will you give 'em hell, miss Carousel,<br/>
 when they're begging you to hide them<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and get me when<br/>
You're sure that you don't need me then<br/>
I'll stand outside your window<br/>
and proudly call your name<br/>
<br/>
When they need a rose, your eyes felt closed<br/>
You clamped your fingers around your nose<br/>
Would you say, that's anyway to judge him<br/>
Well you haven't got the authority<br/>
too kill him in the first degree<br/>
But would you feel compelled, miss Carousel,<br/>
if you had something to regret in<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and get me when<br/>
You're sure that you don't need me then<br/>
I'll stand outside your window<br/>
and proudly call your name<br/>
<br/>
On velvet beach far beneath the reach<br/>
of those who come to pray and preach<br/>
The natural man that tried to stand is falling<br/>
Well how long will it be before he sees<br/>
you own his legs but his mind is free<br/>
only you can tell , miss Carousel,<br/>
how long will he be crawling<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and get me when<br/>
You're sure that you don't need me then<br/>
I'll stand outside your window<br/>
and proudly call your name<br/>
<br/>
All the castle walls grown so tall<br/>
Seems there ain't no hope at all<br/>
to reach the top even though you stopped for breathing<br/>
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry<br/>
the teardrops couldn't find your eyes<br/>
It's all been swell, miss Carousel,<br/>
but the time has come for leaving<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and get me when<br/>
You're sure that you don't need me then    <-(x4)<br/>
I'll stand outside your window<br/>
and proudly call your name<br/>
