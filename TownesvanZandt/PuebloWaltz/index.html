How many of your skies are blue?<br/>
How much of your love is true?<br/>
Where to get them eyes of green?<br/>
I'm knowin' you know just what I mean<br/>
<br/>
If I have to go I won't be long<br/>
maybe we'll move to Tennessee<br/>
leave these Texas blues behind<br/>
see Susanna and Guy<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm in this cold room all alone<br/>
I guess I'll try the telephone<br/>
it'll be busy or she won't be home<br/>
tomorrow is another day<br/>
<br/>
Sunrise comes and I don't know why<br/>
living loves and the day does fly<br/>
soon the moon and baby and I<br/>
will be lyin' side by side<br/>
