I won't be forgetting you<br/>
And you won't be forgetting me, I know<br/>
If memory comes a summer cloud<br/>
Rains a sweetness down to me below<br/>
I see you like you look right now<br/>
Maybe wonder why I had to go<br/>
But heaven is the way she is<br/>
Rain falls and rivers flow<br/>
<br/>
So here's to feelin' good<br/>
And here's to feelin' bad<br/>
Here's to bein' thankful<br/>
I'm sorry for the pleasures that we had<br/>
Autumn days and window panes<br/>
God forgive us if you feel deceived<br/>
But the clock don't know you like I do<br/>
It's only him or me you've got to believe<br/>
