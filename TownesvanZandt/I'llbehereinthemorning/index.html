           C                      F                                         C   
There's no stronger wind than the one that blows down the lonesome railroad line
   C                                     D               G    
No prettier sight than lookin' back at a town you left behind
            C                             F                 C
But there's nothin' that's as real as the love that's in my mind.

G                                   F
Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The Mornin'
G                    F             Am
Close your eyes I'll be here for a while.

There's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whispers louder than the highway's call to me

chorus

All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your bluely dancin' eyes and yellow shinin' hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you lyin' there

chorus

Aw lay your head back easy love and close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
And I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome Blue Jay cries.

chorus
