I ain't gonna <b>C</b>sing no lonesome tune<br/>
<br/>
Aw, babe I'm a comin' soon<br/>
I can<b>G</b>not b'leive I stayed so long away<br/>
But a <b>C</b>man must look around<br/>
<br/>
And you're the sweetest thing I've found<br/>
Aw, your <b>G</b>lost high roller's rolling home <b>C</b>today<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well my daddy said to me<br/>
Son, it's hard as you will see<br/>
To find someone upon whom to rely<br/>
In the kitchen momma sneezed<br/>
Daddy grinned big as you please<br/>
Said "bless you" and a tear came to his eye<br/>
<br/>
(guitar for one verse)<br/>
<br/>
I did decide that very day<br/>
That I would like to live that way<br/>
And now I know I've just been wasting time<br/>
It's with you that I should be<br/>
And if you feel the same 'bout me<br/>
I'm headed home along the straightest line<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune<br/>
Aw, babe I'm a comin' soon<br/>
I cannot b'leive I stayed so long away<br/>
But a man must look around<br/>
And you're the sweetest thing I've found<br/>
Aw, your lost high roller's rolling home today<br/>
