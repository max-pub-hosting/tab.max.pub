And the old man <b>G</b>mowin’ down his lawn<br/>
<b>A</b>He didn’t look like much too bad a <b>D</b>guy<br/>
<br/>
And I was thinkin’ “Hang on, man, somethin’s wrong<br/>
Your blues they do seem to be gone,”<br/>
Heaven ain’t bad but you don’t get nothin’ done<br/>
<br/>
<b>F#</b>Lay down your head awhil<b>G</b>e<br/>

You are not needed now<b>D</b><br/>
<br/>
Well Allison laid an egg on me<br/>
And every time I turn around<br/>
It’s swimmin’ through the air above my bed<br/>
<br/>
And I told Miss Hicks and she said fine<br/>
Long as you’re back in your room on time<br/>
I’ll keep you clean the girls will keep you fed<br/>
<br/>
Lay down your head with mine<br/>
You are not needed now<br/>
And we got things to do<br/>
<br/>
Well between the blankets made of wool<br/>
The trains go by every half an hour<br/>
And a body can’t get no restin’ done it’s true<br/>
<br/>
So I spend my time as best I can<br/>
Thinkin’ big and makin’ plans<br/>
And wonderin’ where them trains are rollin’ to<br/>
<br/>
Lay down your head poor boy<br/>
Feel how the ground does move<br/>
And hear how them drivers sing<br/>
<br/>
Well goodbye friends it’s time to close<br/>
Everybody knows that’s the way it goes<br/>
Where was it you lived in case I’m ever there?<br/>
<br/>
Well three doors down and two behind<br/>
And it gets a little bit out of hand sometimes<br/>
Don’t let it fool you into thinkin’ you don’t care<br/>
<br/>
Lay down your head and fly<br/>
And I’ll quietly pass you by<br/>
You won’t even see me go<br/>
<br/>
Well if I thought about it long enough<br/>
I just might make some kind of move<br/>
Watchful eyes are too hard on the soul<br/>
<br/>
With the smokehouse just across the way<br/>
And this fog upon the light of day<br/>
I’d be hard pressed comin’ up with where to go<br/>
<br/>
Lay down your head poor boy<br/>
Feel how the ground does move<br/>
And hear how them drivers sing<br/>
<br/>
And what now my darling one?<br/>
We’ll go find a little fun<br/>
You are not needed now.<br/>
