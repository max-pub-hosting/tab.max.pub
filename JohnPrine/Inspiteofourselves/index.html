<h5>CShe don't like her eggs all runny</h5>
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny<br/>
She [F]looks down her nose at money<br/>
She [C]gets it on like the Easter Bunny<br/>
<h5>GShe's my baby, I'm her honey</h5>
I'm never gonna let her [C]go [G] [C]<br/>
<br/>
HER VERSE<br/>
<h5>CHe ain't got laid in a month of Sundays</h5>
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies<br/>
He [F]ain't too sharp but he gets things done<br/>
<h5>CDrinks his beer like it's oxygen</h5>
<h5>GHe's my baby, And I'm his honey</h5>
Never gonna let him [C]go [G]  [C]<br/>
<br/>
COMBO CHORUS<br/>
In spite of [F]ourselves<br/>
We'll end up a'sittin' on a [C]rainbow<br/>
Against all [G]odds<br/>
Honey, we're the big door [C]prize [G]  [C]<br/>
We're gonna [F]spite our noses<br/>
Right off of our [C]faces<br/>
There won't be nothin' but big old [G]hearts<br/>
Dancin' in our [C]eyes. [G]  [C]<br/>
<br/>
HIS VERSE<br/>
<h5>CShe thinks all my jokes are corny</h5>
Convict movies make her horny<br/>
She [F]likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs<br/>
<h5>CSwears like a sailor when she shaves her legs</h5>
<h5>GShe takes a lickin' but she keeps on tickin'</h5>
I'm never gonna let her [C]go. [G]  [C]<br/>
<br/>
HER VERSE<br/>
<h5>CHe's got more balls than a big brass monkey</h5>
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie<br/>
<h5>FHe's sly as a fox and crazy as a loon</h5>
<h5>CWhen payday comes, he's howlin' at the moon</h5>
<h5>GBut he's my baby.  I don't mean maybe</h5>
Never gonna let him [C]go [G] [C]<br/>
<br/>
In spite of [F]ourselves<br/>
We'll end up a'sittin' on a [C]rainbow<br/>
Against all [G]odds<br/>
Honey, we're the big door [C]prize [G]  [C]<br/>
We're gonna [F]spite our noses<br/>
Right off of our [C]faces<br/>
There won't be nothin' but big old [G]hearts<br/>
Dancin' in our [C]eyes.  [G]  [F]  [C]<br/>
