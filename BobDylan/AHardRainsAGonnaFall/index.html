Oh, <b>D</b>where have you been, my <b>G</b>blue-eyed <b>D</b>son?<br/>
And <b>D</b>where have you been, my darling young <b>A</b>one?<br/>
I've <b>G/d</b>stumbled on the side of <b>A/d</b>twelve misty <b>D</b>mountains,<br/>
I've <b>G/d</b>walked and I've crawled on <b>A/d</b>six crooked <b>D</b>highways,<br/>
I've <b>G/d</b>stepped in the middle of <b>A/d</b>seven sad <b>D</b>forests,<br/>
I've <b>G/d</b>been out in front of a <b>A/d</b>dozen dead <b>D</b>oceans,<br/>
I've been <b>G/d</b>ten thousand miles in the <b>A/d</b>mouth of a <b>D</b>graveyard,<br/>
And <b>*)</b>it's a <b>D</b>hard, and it's a <b>A</b>hard, it's a <b>D</b>hard, and it's a <b>G</b>hard,<br/>
And it's a <b>D</b>hard rain<b>A</b>'s a-gonna <b>D</b>fall.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br/>
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br/>
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br/>
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,<br/>
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',<br/>
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',<br/>
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,<br/>
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,<br/>
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,<br/>
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,<br/>
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.<br/>
<br/>
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br/>
And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br/>
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',<br/>
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,<br/>
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',<br/>
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',<br/>
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',<br/>
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,<br/>
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,<br/>
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,<br/>
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br/>
Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br/>
I met a young child beside a dead pony,<br/>
I met a white man who walked a black dog,<br/>
I met a young woman whose body was burning,<br/>
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,<br/>
I met one man who was wounded in love,<br/>
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,<br/>
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,<br/>
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br/>
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?<br/>
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',<br/>
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,<br/>
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,<br/>
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,<br/>
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,<br/>
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,<br/>
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,<br/>
Where black is the color, where none is the number,<br/>
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,<br/>
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,<br/>
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',<br/>
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',<br/>
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,<br/>
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.<br/>
