     Am<b>Come...</b><br/>
Come gather 'round friends<br/>
And I'll <b>G</b>tell you a tale<br/>
Of when the <b>Am</b>red iron <b>G</b>ore pits ran a-<b>Am</b>plenty.<br/>
<br/>
But the cardboard filled windows<br/>
And old <b>G</b>men on the benches<br/>
Tell you <b>Am</b>now that the <b>G</b>whole town is <b>Am</b>empty.<br/>
<br/>
In the north end of town,<br/>
My own children are grown<br/>
But I was raised on the other.<br/>
In the wee hours of youth,<br/>
My mother took sick<br/>
And I was brought up by my brother.<br/>
<br/>
The iron ore poured<br/>
As the years passed the door,<br/>
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming.<br/>
'Til one day my brother<br/>
Failed to come home<br/>
The same as my father before him.<br/>
<br/>
Well a long winter's wait,<br/>
From the window I watched.<br/>
My friends they couldn't have been kinder.<br/>
And my schooling was cut<br/>
As I quit in the spring<br/>
To marry John Thomas, a miner.<br/>
<br/>
Oh the years passed again<br/>
And the givin' was good,<br/>
With the lunch bucket filled every season.<br/>
What with three babies born,<br/>
The work was cut down<br/>
To a half-a-day shift with no reason.<br/>
<br/>
Then the shaft was soon shut<br/>
And more work was cut,<br/>
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen.<br/>
'Til a man come to speak<br/>
And he said, in one week<br/>
That number eleven was closin'.<br/>
<br/>
They complained in the East,<br/>
They are paying too high.<br/>
They say that your ore ain't worth digging.<br/>
That it's much cheaper down<br/>
In the South American towns<br/>
Where the miners work almost for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
So the mining gates locked<br/>
And the red iron rotted<br/>
And the room smelled heavy from drinking.<br/>
When the sad, silent song<br/>
Made the hour twice as long<br/>
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.<br/>
<br/>
I lived by the window<br/>
As he talked to himself,<br/>
This silence of tongues it was building.<br/>
Till one morning's wake,<br/>
The bed it was bare,<br/>
And I's left alone with three children.<br/>
<br/>
The summer is gone,<br/>
The ground's turning cold,<br/>
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'.<br/>
My children will go<br/>
As soon as they grow.<br/>
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.<br/>
