<b>C</b>They were hiding behind hay bales,<br/>
They were <b>F</b>planting in the <b>C</b>Full Moon,<br/>
They had given all they <b>Am7</b>had for something <b>F</b>new<b>G</b><br/>
But the <b>C</b>light of day was on them,<br/>
They could <b>F</b>see the thrasher <b>C</b>coming,<br/>
And the water shone like <b>Am7</b>diamonds in the <b>F</b>dew.<b>G</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>F</b>And I was just <b>G</b>getting up,<br/>
To <b>C</b>hit the road before its <b>F</b>light,<br/>
trying to catch an <b>G</b>hour on the <b>C</b>sun,<<b>Cmaj7</b>b>C</b<b>Cmaj7</b>><br/>
<b>F</b>When I saw those thrasher<b>G</b>s rolling by,<br/>
Looking <b>C</b>more than  <b>C/B</b>two lanes <b>Am7</b>wide,<b>Am/C</b><br/>
I was <b>Dm7</b>feeling like my day had just <b>G</b>begun.<br/>
<br/>
Where the <b>C</b>eagles glide descending,<br/>
There's an <b>F</b>ancient river <b>C</b>bending,<br/>
Down the <b>C</b>timeless <b>C/B</b>gorge of <b>Am7</b>changes <b>Am7/G</b>where s<b>F</b>leeplessness a<b>G</b>waits,<br/>
I <b>C</b>searched out my companions,<br/>
who were <b>F</b>lost in crystal <b>C</b>canyons,<br/>
When the <b>C</b>aimless <b>C/B</b>blade of <b>Am7</b>science <b>Am7/G</b>slashed the <b>F</b>pearly gates,<b>G</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>F</b>It was then I knew I'd <b>G</b>had enough, burned my <b>C</b>credit card for <b>F</b>fuel,<br/>
<b>F</b>Headed out to where the <b>G</b>pavement turns to <b>C</b>sand,<b>Cmaj7</b><b>C</b><br/>
With a <b>F</b>one-way ticket to the <b>G</b>land of truth and my <b>C</b>suitcase <b>C/B</b>in my <b>Am7</b>hand.<b>Am7/G</b><br/>
How I <b>Dm7</b>lost my friends I still dont understan<b>G</b>d.<br/>
<br/>
<b>C</b>They had the best selection,<br/>
They were <b>F</b>poisoned with pro<b>C</b>tection,<br/>
There was <b>C</b>nothing <b>C/B</b>that they <b>Am7</b>needed, <b>Am7/G</b><br/>
<b>F</b>nothing left to <b>G</b>find.<br/>
They were <b>C</b>lost in rock formations,<br/>
Or <b>F</b>became park bench mut<b>C</b>ations,<br/>
On the the <b>C</b>sidewalks <b>C/B</b>and in the <b>Am7</b>stations,<b>Am7/G</b>      they were <b>F</b>waiting, <b>G</b>waiting.<br/>
<b>F</b>So I got bored and <b>G</b>left them there,<br/>
They were <b>C</b>just dead weight to <b>F</b>me,<br/>
<b>F</b>Better down the <b>G</b>road without that <b>C</b>load,<b>Cmaj7</b><b>C</<b>Cmaj7</b>b><br/>
<b>F</b>Bring's back the time I was <b>G</b>eight or nine,<br/>
I was <b>C</b>watching my Mama's <b>Am7</b>TV,<b>Am7/G</b><br/>
It was that <b>Dm7</b>great Grand Canyon rescue episod<b>G</b>e.<br/>
With the <b>C</b>vulture glides descending,<br/>
On an <b>F</b>asphalt highway <b>C</b>bending,<br/>
Through <b>C</b>libraries <b>C/B</b>and muse<b>Am7</b>ums,<b>Am7/G</b>       <b>F</b>galaxies and <b>G</b>stars.<br/>
<br/>
Down the <b>C</b>windy halls of friendship,<br/>
To the <b>F</b>rose clipped by the <b>C</b>bullwhip,<br/>
The <b>C</b>motel of <b>C/B</b>lost c<b>Am7</b>ompanions <b>Am7/G</b>waits with <b>F</b>heated pool and <b>G</b>bar.<br/>
<b>F</b>But me, I'm not <b>G</b>stopping there,<br/>
Got my o<b>C</b>wn row left to <b>F</b>hoe,<br/>
<b>F</b>Just another <b>G</b>line in the field of <b>C</b>time.<b>Cmaj7</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>F</b>When the thrashers come I'll be <b>G</b>stuck in the sun,<br/>
Like the <b>C</b>dinosaurs in <b>Am7</b>shrines,<b>Am7/G</b><br/>
But I'll <b>Dm7</b>know the time has come to give what's <b>G</b>mine.<br/>
