C             C7          F          C
I ain't got nobody, ain't nobody got me,

F                      C      D7            G7
I'm just like a little apple, hanging on a tree,

C                  C7 F             C
Don't nobody want me, I can plainly see,

F             C         G7               C
I ain't got nobody, and ain't nobody got me. 


Second verse:

I ain't got nobody, ain't nobody got me,
I'm just like a chunk of wood, floating on the sea.
Don't nobody want me, I can plainly see,
I ain't got nobody, and ain't nobody got me.</main>
