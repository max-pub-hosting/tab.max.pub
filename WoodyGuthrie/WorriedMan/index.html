<br/>
It <b>G</b>takes a worried man to sing a worried song<br/>
It <b>C</b>takes a worried man to sing a worried <b>G</b>song<br/>
I'm worried <b>D</b>now, but I won't be worried <b>G</b>long<br/>
<br/>
I <b>G</b>went across the river and I lay down to sleep<br/>
I <b>C</b>went across the river and I lay down to <b>G</b>sleep<br/>
When I woke <b>D</b>up, I had the shackles and my <b>G</b>feet<br/>
<br/>
<b>G</b>Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg<br/>
<b>C</b>Twenty-nine links of chain around my <b>G</b>leg<br/>
And on each <b>D</b>link is the initial of my <b>G</b>name<br/>
<br/>
chorus<br/>
<br/>
I <b>G</b>asked the judge, what might be my fine<br/>
I <b>C</b>asked the judge, what might be my <b>G</b>fine<br/>
Twenty-one <b>D</b>years on that Rocky Mountain <b>G</b>Line<br/>
<br/>
The <b>G</b>train that I ride, is sixteen coaches long<br/>
The <b>C</b>train that I ride, is  sixteen coaches <b>G</b>long<br/>
The girl I <b>D</b>love is on that train and <b>G</b>gone<br/>
