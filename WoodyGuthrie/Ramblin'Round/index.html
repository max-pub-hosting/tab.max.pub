Ramblin' around your city,
                     C
Ramblin' around your town,
              F
I never see a friend I know
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round boys,
   G              C
As I go ramblin' 'round.

C                    G
My sweetheart and my parents
                     C
I left in my old hometown
                  F
I'm out to do the best I can
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round

    C                    G
The peach trees they are loaded,
                      C
The limbs are bending down,
                         F
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round

    C                    G
Sometimes the fruit gets rotten
                      C
And falls down on the ground,
                           F
There's a hungry mouth for every peach
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round boys,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round

  C                 G
I wish that I could marry,
                        C
I wished I could settle down,
                   F
But I can't save a penny boys,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round

   C                  G
My mother prayed that I would be
                C
A man of some reknown,
                F
But I am just a refugee,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round boys,
   G              C 
As I go ramblin' 'round
