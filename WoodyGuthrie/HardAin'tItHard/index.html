There is a house in this old town, 
C                               G7
That's where my true love lays around,
          C                       F
Well, she takes other women right down on her knee, 
        C                   G7                       C 
And she tells them a little tale that she won't tell me.

Chorus:
                                  F
It's hard and it's hard, ain't it hard,
   C                            G7
To love one that never did love you.
     C                            F  
It's hard and it's hard, ain't it hard, great God,
   C             G7            C
To love one that never will be true.

Well, the first time that I seen my true love,
He (she) was a-walkin' past my door,
And the last time I seen his (her) false-hearted smile,
He (she) was dead on his (her) coolin' board.

Chorus

Now don't go to drinkin' and a-gamblin'
Don't go there your sorrows to drown,
That hard liquor place is a low-down disgrace,
It's the meanest damn place in this town.

Chorus

Now who's a-gonna kiss your ruby lips,
And who's a-gonna hold you to their breast,
Who's a-gonna talk the future over,
While I'm a-ramblin' in the West?
